# Project Overview

## Purpose
This is a research project analyzing state-level special education policies and their impact on student outcomes. The project uses quasi-experimental methods to identify causal effects of policy reforms on achievement, inclusion, and equity for students with disabilities (SWD).

## Key Research Innovation
First study combining COVID-19 disruption with state policy variation to identify which approaches proved most resilient and effective for students with disabilities. The project contributes to the $190B IDEA reauthorization debate by providing first causal estimates using post-COVID special education data.

## Research Methods
- **Staggered Difference-in-Differences**: Exploiting timing of state funding formula reforms (2009-2023)
- **Instrumental Variables**: Using court-ordered funding increases and federal monitoring changes
- **COVID Natural Experiment**: Triple-difference design comparing pre/post COVID by reform status
- **Event Studies**: Analyzing effects around policy implementation dates

## Data Sources
- NAEP State Assessments (2009-2022) for achievement outcomes
- EdFacts/IDEA Reports (2009-2023) for inclusion rates and graduation
- Census F-33 Finance Data for per-pupil spending
- Hand-collected state policy database (funding formulas, court orders, federal monitoring)

## Project Status (2025-08-15)
- âœ… NAEP Achievement Data: 1,200 records collected (100% coverage)
- âœ… Census F-33 Finance Data: 153 state-year records parsed
