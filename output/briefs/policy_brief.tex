{\LARGE \textbf{\color{headerblue}Special Education Policy Reform:}}\\
{\Large \textbf{Evidence from State-Level Analysis}}\\[0.5em]
{\large Policy Brief | 2024}

\section*{Executive Summary}
This brief summarizes findings from a comprehensive analysis of state-level special education 
policy reforms from 2009-2022. Using rigorous quasi-experimental methods, we examined how 
funding formula changes affected student outcomes, with special attention to COVID-19 impacts.

\section*{Key Findings}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.5em]
\item State funding formula reforms show limited impact on special education outcomes
\item Achievement gaps persist despite policy interventions
\item COVID-19 disrupted progress across all states equally
\item Inclusion rates improved modestly in reform states
\item Per-pupil spending increased but did not translate to better outcomes

\end{itemize}

\section*{Policy Implications}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.5em]
\item Funding alone may not be sufficient to improve outcomes
\item Implementation quality matters more than policy design
\item Need for targeted support during crisis periods
\item Focus on teacher training and support systems

\end{itemize}

\section*{Recommendations}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.5em]
\item Invest in teacher professional development for special education
\item Develop crisis response protocols for vulnerable populations
\item Implement evidence-based instructional practices
\item Strengthen accountability and monitoring systems
\item Foster parent and community engagement

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Methodology at a Glance}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.3em]
\item Analyzed 50 states over 14 years (2009-2022)
\item Used difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment
\item Examined multiple outcomes: achievement, gaps, inclusion, graduation
\item Conducted extensive robustness tests including bootstrap and permutation methods
\end{itemize}
