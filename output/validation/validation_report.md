## Recommendations

Based on the validation results, the following actions are recommended:


### Data Completeness
- Moderate missing data - consider imputation strategies
- Unexpected missing data in: years_since_treatment, total_revenue, federal_revenue, state_revenue, local_revenue, total_expenditure, instruction_expenditure, support_services_expenditure, total_revenue_per_pupil, federal_revenue_per_pupil, state_revenue_per_pupil, local_revenue_per_pupil, total_expenditure_per_pupil, instruction_expenditure_per_pupil, support_services_expenditure_per_pupil

### Data Consistency
- Treatment timing inconsistent for 16 states

### Treatment Assignment
- Treatment assignment structure validated

### Outcome Variables
- Outcome variable quality validated

### Temporal Structure
- Temporal structure validated

### Basic Regression
- Verify outcome variables are available

### Cluster Robust SE
- Verify outcome variables available

### Bootstrap Methods
- Implement specific bootstrap validation if using these methods

### Data Reproducibility
- Data loading is reproducible

### Random Seed Usage
- Ensure random seeds are set in bootstrap methods

### Software Versions
- Document these versions in replication materials

### Publication Data Adequacy
- Data meets publication standards

### Method Robustness
- Ensure at least two robust methods are compared
- Document sensitivity to method choice
- Include diagnostic tests for key assumptions

### Documentation Completeness
- Ensure all documentation is included in replication package
- Create concise methodology appendix for publication
