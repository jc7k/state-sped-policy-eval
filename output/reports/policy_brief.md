## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Staggered Difference-in-Differences Analysis
Our analysis of 16 state special education funding reforms (2009-2023) reveals mixed effects on achievement gaps:

- **Math Grade 4**: 0.054 point change in achievement gap
- **Math Grade 8**: 0.564 point change in achievement gap
- **Reading Grade 4**: -1.150 point change in achievement gap
- **Reading Grade 8**: 0.773 point change in achievement gap

### 2. Instrumental Variables Analysis
Using court orders and federal monitoring as instruments, we find larger treatment effects, suggesting states self-select into reforms based on unobserved factors:

- **Math Grade 4**: -1.924 point IV effect (vs 0.054 DiD effect)
- **Math Grade 8**: 4.126 point IV effect (vs 0.564 DiD effect)
- **Reading Grade 4**: -5.826 point IV effect (vs -1.150 DiD effect)
- **Reading Grade 8**: -3.709 point IV effect (vs 0.773 DiD effect)

### 3. COVID-19 Resilience Analysis
Policy reforms showed mixed resilience effects during the pandemic, with no statistically significant interactions detected.

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS

### Federal Level (IDEA Reauthorization)
1. **Evidence-Based Funding**: Require states to demonstrate evidence-based approaches in funding formula design
2. **Minimum Thresholds**: Establish federal per-pupil funding floors for special education services
3. **Monitoring Systems**: Strengthen federal oversight of state compliance and outcomes

### State Level Recommendations
1. **Early Implementation**: Earlier reform implementation (pre-2020) appears more effective than recent changes
2. **Comprehensive Approach**: Funding reforms alone insufficient; combine with inclusion and service delivery improvements
3. **Data Systems**: Invest in robust data collection and monitoring systems for continuous improvement

### Research and Practice
1. **Continued Monitoring**: Long-term effects may emerge beyond our study period (2009-2023)
2. **Implementation Quality**: Focus on fidelity of reform implementation, not just policy adoption
3. **Targeted Interventions**: Consider disability-specific and grade-level differentiated approaches

## METHODOLOGY SUMMARY

**Sample**: 51 states Ã— 15 years = 765 observations
**Treatment States**: 16 states implementing funding reforms (2009-2023) 
**Identification Strategy**: 
- Staggered difference-in-differences (Callaway-Sant'Anna 2021)
- Instrumental variables (court orders, federal monitoring)
- COVID-19 natural experiment (triple-difference)

**Data Sources**:
- NAEP State Assessments (achievement gaps)
- Census F-33 Education Finance (per-pupil spending)
- Hand-coded state policy database (reform timing)

## LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

1. **Statistical Power**: COVID analysis limited by three-year observation window
2. **Implementation Details**: Policy coding captures adoption, not implementation quality
3. **Heterogeneous Effects**: Future work should examine effects by disability category and demographic groups
4. **Long-term Effects**: Extended follow-up needed to capture delayed impacts
