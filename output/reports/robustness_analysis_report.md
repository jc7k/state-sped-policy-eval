## Robustness Tests Completed

### Traditional Methods
1. **Leave-One-State-Out Analysis**: Tests sensitivity to individual states
2. **Alternative Clustering**: Compares standard errors across clustering methods
3. **Permutation Test**: Tests significance under random treatment assignment
4. **Specification Curve**: Tests sensitivity to model specification choices

### Alternative Robust Methods (Phase 2)
5. **Bootstrap Inference**: Cluster bootstrap for robust standard errors
6. **Jackknife Inference**: Leave-one-state-out inference method
7. **Wild Cluster Bootstrap**: Robust inference for small cluster counts

## Key Findings

- **Leave-One-State-Out**: Tested 3 outcomes across individual state exclusions
- **Permutation Test**: 0/3 outcomes significant at 5% level
- **Specification Curve**: 12 total specifications tested across outcomes

## Alternative Method Results

- **Bootstrap Inference**: 3/3 outcomes with robust results
  - math_grade4_swd_score: β=-0.168, SE=1.407, p=0.868
  - math_grade4_non_swd_score: β=0.457, SE=0.827, p=0.572
  - math_grade4_gap: β=0.626, SE=1.146, p=0.540
- **Jackknife Inference**: 3/3 outcomes with robust results
  - math_grade4_swd_score: β=-0.168, SE=1.415, p=0.906
  - math_grade4_non_swd_score: β=0.457, SE=0.840, p=0.589
  - math_grade4_gap: β=0.626, SE=1.193, p=0.602
- **Wild Cluster Bootstrap**: 3/3 outcomes with robust results
  - math_grade4_swd_score: β=-0.168, wild p=0.913
  - math_grade4_non_swd_score: β=0.457, wild p=0.642
  - math_grade4_gap: β=0.626, wild p=0.631

## Conclusion

The robustness analysis provides evidence on the stability of main treatment effects. 
Results should be interpreted alongside the main causal analysis to assess the 
overall credibility of the special education policy evaluation findings.
