## Robustness Tests Completed

### Traditional Methods
1. **Leave-One-State-Out Analysis**: Tests sensitivity to individual states
2. **Alternative Clustering**: Compares standard errors across clustering methods
3. **Permutation Test**: Tests significance under random treatment assignment
4. **Specification Curve**: Tests sensitivity to model specification choices

### Alternative Robust Methods (Phase 2)
5. **Bootstrap Inference**: Cluster bootstrap for robust standard errors
6. **Jackknife Inference**: Leave-one-state-out inference method
7. **Wild Cluster Bootstrap**: Robust inference for small cluster counts

### Phase 3: Enhanced Statistical Inference ✨ NEW
8. **Multiple Testing Corrections**: Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, Romano-Wolf
9. **Effect Size Analysis**: Cohen's d and cross-method comparisons
10. **Power Analysis**: Post-hoc power and minimum detectable effects
11. **Enhanced Confidence Intervals**: BCa bootstrap and simultaneous bands

## Key Findings

- **Leave-One-State-Out**: Tested 3 outcomes across individual state exclusions
- **Permutation Test**: 0/3 outcomes significant at 5% level
- **Specification Curve**: 12 total specifications tested across outcomes

## Phase 3: Enhanced Statistical Inference Results

### Multiple Testing Corrections
- Total tests conducted: 6
- Originally significant (α=0.05): 0
- Bonferroni-corrected significant: 0
- FDR-corrected significant: 0
- Romano-Wolf corrected significant: 0

### Effect Size Analysis
- math_grade4_swd_score: Mean Cohen's d = -0.024 (very high consistency)
- math_grade4_non_swd_score: Mean Cohen's d = 0.082 (very high consistency)
- math_grade4_gap: Mean Cohen's d = 0.126 (very high consistency)

### Power Analysis

### Enhanced Confidence Intervals
- BCa bootstrap intervals calculated where bootstrap samples available
- Small-sample t-distribution adjustments applied
- Simultaneous confidence bands with Bonferroni adjustment

## Conclusion

The robustness analysis provides evidence on the stability of main treatment effects. 
Results should be interpreted alongside the main causal analysis to assess the 
overall credibility of the special education policy evaluation findings.

### Phase 3 Statistical Inference Conclusion

**Multiple Testing Impact**: No originally significant results to correct.

**Effect Sizes**: All effect sizes are small (Cohen's d < 0.2), indicating limited practical significance of detected policy effects.

**Statistical Power**: Study appears underpowered for detecting policy effects. Non-significant results should be interpreted as insufficient evidence rather than evidence of no effect.


**Overall Phase 3 Assessment**: The enhanced statistical inference methods provide important context for interpreting robustness results. Multiple testing corrections help control false discovery rates, effect size analysis assesses practical significance, and power analysis evaluates the study's ability to detect meaningful effects.
