## Analysis Overview

- **Dataset**: data/final/analysis_panel.csv
- **Specifications**: 5 econometric models
- **Outcomes**: 5 dependent variables
- **Treatment States**: 93

## Model Specifications

1. **Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)**: Basic DiD with state and year fixed effects
2. **Event Study**: Dynamic treatment effects from -5 to +5 years
3. **Callaway-Sant'Anna**: Manual implementation for staggered adoption
4. **Instrumental Variables**: Using court orders as instruments
5. **COVID Triple-Difference**: Policy resilience during pandemic disruption

## Key Results

- **Twfe**: 1/5 outcomes significant at 5% level
- **Event Study**: 0/5 outcomes significant at 5% level
- **Callaway Santanna**: 0/5 outcomes significant at 5% level
- **Covid Analysis**: 0/5 outcomes significant at 5% level

## Files Generated

1. **Tables**:
   - `table2_main_results.csv` - Main results in CSV format
   - `table2_main_results.tex` - LaTeX formatted table
   - `covid_ddd_results_*.csv` - COVID analysis results by outcome
   - `covid_ddd_model_summary_*.txt` - COVID model summaries

2. **Figures**:
   - Event study plots for each outcome variable
