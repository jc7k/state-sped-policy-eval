## Robustness Tests Completed

1. **Leave-One-State-Out Analysis**: Tests sensitivity to individual states
2. **Alternative Clustering**: Compares standard errors across clustering methods
3. **Permutation Test**: Tests significance under random treatment assignment
4. **Specification Curve**: Tests sensitivity to model specification choices

## Key Findings

- **Leave-One-State-Out**: Tested 0 outcomes across individual state exclusions
- **Permutation Test**: 0/3 outcomes significant at 5% level
- **Specification Curve**: 0 total specifications tested across outcomes

## Files Generated

1. **Tables**:
   - `table3_robustness_results.csv` - Robustness results in CSV format
   - `table3_robustness_results.tex` - LaTeX formatted table

2. **Figures**:
   - `robustness_loso.png` - Leave-one-state-out plots
   - `robustness_specification_curve.png` - Specification curve analysis
   - `robustness_permutation.png` - Permutation test results

## Conclusion

The robustness analysis provides evidence on the stability of main treatment effects. 
Results should be interpreted alongside the main causal analysis to assess the 
overall credibility of the special education policy evaluation findings.
