\section*{Executive Summary}
This brief summarizes findings from a comprehensive analysis of state-level special education 
policy reforms from 2009-2022. Using rigorous quasi-experimental methods, we examined how 
funding formula changes affected student outcomes, with special attention to COVID-19 impacts.

\item Analyzed 50 states over 14 years (2009-2022)
\item Used difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment
\item Examined multiple outcomes: achievement, gaps, inclusion, graduation
\item Conducted extensive robustness tests including bootstrap and permutation methods
\end{itemize}
